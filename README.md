# NLP StanfordNLP MachineLearning
The project contains 2 components :
1. Stanford NLP used to separate out nouns from verbs, conjunctions, prepositions etc.
2. I am feeding the nouns to an external API ( https://app.monkeylearn.com/ ) for classification purpose . They use a classification model based on manually curated Wikipedia data. 

All the project dependencies are present in pom.xml.

Please ask the questions in the following manner for the code to identify the nouns correctly :
"What is KingKong Movies showtime?"
"What is the Flight status?"
"Which are the Restaurant Around?"
